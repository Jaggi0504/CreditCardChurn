### Credit Card Churn Prediction

1. Leveraged an ML model (RandomForestClassifier) and solved the classification problem.
2. Focused more on a good F1-score because the dataset was highly imbalanced and accuracy was not a good metric.
3. Created a pickle file and loaded that pickle file into the environment.
4. Used Flask framework for building APIs (predict_api/predict).
5. Created a DockerFile and containerize the application.
